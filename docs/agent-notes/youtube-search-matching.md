# YouTube search matching (`src/utils/youtube/manage_youtube_playlists.py`)

`score_result()` picks the "best match" video for a DB song, searching via yt-dlp first (free)
then falling back to the YouTube Data API. Several earlier, simpler versions of this function
caused real wrong-song matches — this file documents why the current logic looks the way it does,
so it doesn't regress if simplified later.

## Why title-only, not artist+title combined

Comparing the full "artist title" string against a candidate's title let two failure modes slip
through:
- A wrong song by a same-named (or similarly spelled) artist could score deceptively high just
  from the artist portion matching.
- A wrong candidate that merely shared a caption/tag with the DB title (e.g. two unrelated videos
  both carrying `[Save Ukraine - #StopWar]`) could look similar for the wrong reason.

`score_result()` computes relevance from the song title alone. Bracket/hashtag stripping
(`_relevance_text()`) removes annotation noise like `[Official Video]` or `#hashtags` from both
sides before comparing, for the same reason.

## Why relevance isn't just similarity()

Plain `difflib.SequenceMatcher` ratio (`text_utils.similarity()`) is unreliable at both ends for
song titles:
- A short, exact title buried in a longer, decorated candidate title gets diluted (title "As" vs
  candidate "Gosia Kunc - As" scores only ~0.24 despite being an exact match — the "Gosia Kunc - "
  prefix dilutes the ratio).
- A short title can *also* score deceptively high against something totally unrelated by sheer
  character-overlap coincidence (`similarity("nix", "netflix top 10 trailer compilation")` ≈ 0.67).

Two mechanisms fix this, together:
- `_title_containment()` checks whether the expected title shows up intact inside the candidate.
  For space-delimited scripts this requires a whole-word/phrase regex match (`\btitle\b`) — not a
  raw substring — otherwise "As" would falsely "contain-match" inside "Asian Kungfu Generation...".
  Scripts written without spaces (CJK ideographs, hiragana/katakana, hangul — matched by
  `_NO_SPACES_SCRIPT`) have no word boundary to anchor on, so a contiguous longest-common-run
  fraction is used instead; that's safe there because each character carries far more information
  than a Latin one, so short runs aren't the same coincidental-match risk.
- `_min_relevance_for()` scales the acceptance bar up for short titles, reusing the
  `scaled_similarity_threshold()` helper from `text_utils.py` (already used there for short artist
  names) instead of a flat constant. This is what actually closes the "netflix ≈ nix" coincidence —
  containment alone isn't picky enough at very short lengths, so the threshold has to be.

Relevance is `max(similarity(...), containment(...))`, gated by `_min_relevance_for(title)` — a
per-title dynamic value, not the flat `MIN_RELEVANCE` constant (that constant is only the floor,
used as-is for long/distinctive titles).

## Why channel/uploader is part of scoring

YouTube auto-generates a `"<Artist> - Topic"` channel per artist for official, single-track audio
uploads — the video *title* on these is deliberately just the bare song title, with no artist
mentioned anywhere in it. `score_result(candidate_title, artist, title, channel="")` handles this
two ways:
- Artist relevance (a soft tiebreaker, not a gate) also checks the channel name, not just the
  title — otherwise a correct Topic-channel match would look like it has zero artist relevance.
- `_is_topic_channel()` gives a `+2` quality bonus to Topic-channel uploads (same weight as an
  "official audio" keyword hit), since they're exactly the plain, unedited version a personal
  library wants.

Both search paths must keep passing `channel` through: `search_video_ytdlp` gets it from yt-dlp's
`channel`/`uploader` JSON fields, `search_video` from the API's `snippet.channelTitle`. Dropping it
silently loses both effects.

## Known regressions this logic exists to prevent

Concrete cases hit during development — useful as a regression checklist if this scoring is ever
simplified:
- `TOR BAND - Бацька [Official Video]` → wrongly matched an unrelated "All inclusive" video
  (title-only + containment now scores this near 0).
- `Vivienne Mort - Душа [Save Ukraine - #StopWar]` → wrongly matched an unrelated video sharing
  only the campaign-tag caption (bracket stripping now excludes that from comparison).
- `Genie - Black Belt` → wrongly matched `"Trick Or Treat"` at relevance 0.38, above the old flat
  0.35 threshold (the scaled per-title threshold now requires 0.5+ for a title this length).
- `Golden Boy With Miss Kittin - Nix` / `Gosia Kunc - As` → correct matches wrongly *rejected*
  because the short exact title was diluted by candidate prefix text (`_title_containment()` now
  rescues these).
- `Cannons - Fire for You` → a `(Sped Up)` edit beat the ordinary version on a relevance tie (now
  deprioritized via `LQ_KEYWORDS`).
- `emade - Jesteś tylko` → the correct video (title "Jesteś tylko", uploaded on the
  "Emade - Topic" channel) wasn't recognized as artist-relevant and wasn't even in the top-5 search
  results (channel-aware artist matching + Topic bonus + widened candidate pool to 8 address this).
